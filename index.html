        <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Luke</strong> (he/him), and I'm from just north of San Francisco (Marin County). I'm a third year computer engineering major. A fun fact about me is that I went to Beyond Wonderland in March! I had a wonderful time. I love to read (currently reading <em>Three Body Problem</em> series) and play video games (R6 and Valorant even though I hate R6). I also would love to one day become a film director.</p>
